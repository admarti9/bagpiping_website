            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I began piping in 2003 in Vancouver, Washington. From 2003 to 2006, I played with the Sir James MacDonald Pipe Band (Grade IV/III) in Portland, Oregon. Between 2006 and 2016, I was a member of the Mesa Caledonian Pipe Band (Grade III) in Mesa, Arizona. From 2015 to 2017, I played with the LA Scots (Grade I) in Los Angeles, California. Between 2018 and 2023, I played with the City of Dunedin Pipe Band (Grade II/I) in Dunedin, Florida.</p>

            <p>Since 2017, I have been with the Loch Norman Pipe Band (Grade V/IV), where I served as Pipe Major from 2018 to 2021 and continue to serve in an instructional capacity. I also teach solo pipers privately.</p>

            <p>I currently compete in solo piping at the Grade I level, with experience at contests including the Nicol-Brown Invitational, Metro Cup, Sherriff Memorial, and Winter Storm.</p>
